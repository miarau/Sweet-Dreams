Sweet Dreams Game

A maze game where you have to collect are your cuddlers and at the same time keep away from the monsters that are chasing you. 

You use the keyboard arrows to get around and you can shoot hearts at the monsters, but only at those above you. After each heart the monster disappears more and more and after five hearts it is gone. 

Level 1: Here you have to find five rabbits and you have seven monsters against you.
